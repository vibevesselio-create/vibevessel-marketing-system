      "Verified Artist + Playlist relation linking is implemented in monolithic-scripts/soundcloud_download_prod_merge-2.py (2026-01-15 fix).",
      "Resolved Notion issue: \"Artist and Playlist relation properties not updated by main production workflow\" (2e9e7361-6c27-81bc-9ba7-d466a01a594d) by updating status to Resolved and documenting config requirements.",
      "Marked the canonical Agent-Task \"Fix Artist/Playlist relation updates in soundcloud_download_prod_merge-2.py\" as Completed and archived 3 duplicate copies."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Relation linking requires ARTISTS_DB_ID and MUSIC_PLAYLISTS_DB_ID/PLAYLISTS_DB_ID env vars and Tracks DB relation properties (Artist/Artists + Playlist/Playlists). If relations still appear empty, likely schema/env config is missing rather than code.",
      "The broader Dropbox Music cleanup + modularization scope in the original handoff remains outstanding and should be broken into smaller follow-up tasks for safe execution."
