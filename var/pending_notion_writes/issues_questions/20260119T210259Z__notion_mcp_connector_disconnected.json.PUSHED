  "description": "During Cross-Workspace Database Sync gap analysis session, the Notion MCP connector (mcp__9195f809-cc08-4573-8e6f-834d11a5c04e) disconnected mid-session. Initial searches and fetches succeeded, but subsequent calls returned 'No such tool available' error. This prevented direct document creation in Notion Documents database.",
  "evidence": {
    "initial_success": "notion-search for 'drivesheets sync script' returned 50 results",
    "failure_error": "Error: No such tool available: mcp__9195f809-cc08-4573-8e6f-834d11a5c04e__notion-fetch",
    "session_timestamp": "2026-01-19T19:12:00Z"
  },
  "impact": "Unable to create documents directly in Notion; forced to use fallback methods (pending_notion_writes JSON queue, trigger files)",
  "workaround": "Created handoff trigger file and pending_notion_writes JSON entries as fallback",
  "next_step": "Investigate MCP connector stability; check for session timeout or authentication issues; consider implementing auto-reconnect logic",
