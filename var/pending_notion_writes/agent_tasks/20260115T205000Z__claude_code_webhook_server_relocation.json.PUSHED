    "Determine the correct target directory in the workspace architecture (e.g., services/webhook_server) and note the rationale",
    "Move webhook server files from /Users/brianhellemn/Projects/github-production/webhook-server to the target directory",
    "Update all path references in launchagents, runbooks, and scripts to the new location",

  "success_criteria": [
    "Webhook server files live in the correct canonical location",
    "All references to the old path are updated",
