Ocean Frontiers Marks 30 Years of East End Diving Leadership in Grand Cayman
Three decades of "Green Shorts Service" helped establish Grand Cayman's East End as a global wall-diving destination
GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands — 14 February 2026 — Ocean Frontiers Dive Shop marks 30 years of operation on Grand Cayman's East End, reflecting three decades of small-group wall and reef diving with a focus on diver safety and environmental stewardship, in partnership with Compass Point Dive Resort.
Ocean Frontiers and Compass Point have been recognised by divers in recent Scuba Diving Magazine Readers Choice Awards across multiple categories for their dive and stay experience.
"We're all about three things — the best dive sites, the best dive boats and the best dive team. Top that off with a strong environmental culture and curated dive itineraries; we deliver incredible experiences that you won't find anywhere else," said Steve Broadbelt, Ocean Frontiers' co-founder.
Operations and Guest Experience
Ocean Frontiers operates a fleet of five vessels, including three custom 46-foot Newton dive boats outfitted with individual gear stations, ample deck space, and extended ladders for added safety and stability when entering and exiting the water. The operation covers 55 named dive sites along the East End, including walls such as Grouper Grotto and Three Sisters and shallow reefs including Babylon and Snapper Hole.
Compass Point Dive Resort offers 28 waterfront condominiums on Grand Cayman's East End in a laid-back boutique setting steps from the dive dock.
Ocean Frontiers' approach — later branded as the Green Shorts Service — focuses on small groups, attentive divemaster support, full gear handling, and consistent investment in the reefs and the community that depend on them.
East End Diving, Plus Signature Excursions
The East End offers wall sites, coral-covered pinnacles, shallow reefs suited to photography and training dives, and swim-throughs and overhangs. With 55 sites in rotation and most within a short boat ride, Ocean Frontiers tailors diving plans to conditions, experience levels, and guest interests.
Signature experiences include the weekly Three Tank Safari to the Kittiwake — the 251-foot retired Navy rescue vessel — with two additional stops on the return, and trips north to Stingray City for a sunset champagne cruise. When marine conditions align, Ocean Frontiers has also run day trips to Little Cayman to explore Bloody Bay Marine Park.
Environmental Stewardship
Ocean Frontiers' environmental initiatives include designation as the first PADI Green Star Dive Center in the Cayman Islands, the establishment of Grand Cayman's largest coral nursery for endangered staghorn and elkhorn corals, and recognition through the Governor's Environmental Award for Tourism, supported by ongoing ocean education partnerships, lionfish culling, and coral monitoring.
Today, the East End is a primary destination for many Cayman visitors, with families booking week-long stays at Compass Point, photographers targeting sites by name, and repeat guests planning travel around seasonal conditions.
