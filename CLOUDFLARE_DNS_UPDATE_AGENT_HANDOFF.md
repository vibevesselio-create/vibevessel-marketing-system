## Files Requiring Update

### Priority 1 - Immediate Update Required

1. **`/Projects/vibevessel-marketing-system/.env`** (if exists) or **`.env.example`**
   - Location: `/sessions/focused-ecstatic-carson/mnt/Projects/vibevessel-marketing-system/.env.example`
   - Update: `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

2. **`/Projects/github-production/.env`**
   - Location: `/sessions/focused-ecstatic-carson/mnt/Projects/github-production/.env`
   - Action: Add Cloudflare configuration section if not present

### Priority 2 - Client Environment Files
- `/Projects/github-production/clients/.env.vibevessel` - Add Cloudflare vars if needed

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Generate API Token (HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED)
1. Navigate to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Use "Edit zone DNS" template or create custom token with:
   - Zone: DNS Edit permissions
   - Zone: Zone Read permissions
   - Include Zone: vibevessel.space
4. Store token securely

### Step 2: Update Environment Files (AGENT ACTION)
```bash
# Add to .env files:
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<generated_token>
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=fd809936bdb57102151e3c631f76cc43
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=d5903a7830890738e0f5bd82af87b5f2
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_ID=dd090a5d-9978-42b9-8e1f-7254e65faaa6
```

### Step 3: Verify DNS Propagation
- Status: **IN PROGRESS** (1-24 hours typical)
- Current nameservers: Propagating to Cloudflare
- Check command: `dig NS vibevessel.space`

### Step 4: Configure DNS Records (Post-Propagation)
After propagation completes:
1. Verify existing records in Cloudflare DNS dashboard
2. Configure proxy status as needed
3. Enable SSL/TLS (Universal SSL certificate will be issued automatically)
