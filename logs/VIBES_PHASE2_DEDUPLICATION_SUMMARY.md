The deduplication analysis has been completed for the VIBES volume. This document summarizes the findings and the planned actions.

## Analysis Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Duplicate Groups** | 5,269 |
| **Total Files Involved** | 11,912 |
| **Files to Archive** | 6,643 |
| **Space Recoverable** | 264.14 GB |
| **Files to Keep** | 5,269 (one per group) |

## Deduplication Strategy

### File Selection Criteria (Scoring System)

Files were scored based on:
1. **Format Quality** (highest weight)
   - WAV: +50 points
   - AIFF/AIF: +40 points
   - FLAC: +30 points
   - M4A: +20 points
   - MP3: +10 points

2. **Metadata Completeness**
   - Has Artist (not "Unknown Artist"): +3 points
   - Has Album (not "Unknown Album"): +2 points
   - Has meaningful Title: +1 point

3. **Location Preference**
   - In /Music/ directory: +5 points
   - In /Apple-Music-Auto-Add/: +3 points
   - In /Music-dep/ or /Unknown Artist/: -2 points

### Selection Result
- **Highest scored file:** KEEP (preserve in place or migrate to target structure)
- **Lower scored files:** ARCHIVE (move to /Volumes/VIBES/Music-Archive/)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **No Deletion:** All files are archived, not deleted
2. **Hard Links:** Where possible, hard links will be used to save space
3. **Verification:** Post-migration file count and size verification
4. **Rollback:** Archive structure allows easy restoration

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. Create target directory structure:
   - `/Volumes/VIBES/Music/Automatically Add to Music.localized/`
   - `/Volumes/VIBES/Music-Backup/`
   - `/Volumes/VIBES/Music-Archive/`

2. Verify disk space availability for archive

3. Proceed to Phase 4 (Dry Run Migration)

## Files Generated

- `vibes_deduplication_plan.json` - Full deduplication mapping (6,643 files)
- `VIBES_PHASE2_DEDUPLICATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Handoff Instructions

Phase 2 is complete. The next agent should:

1. Review this summary and the deduplication plan
2. Execute Phase 3 (Directory Structure Creation)
3. Execute Phase 4 (Dry Run Migration)
4. Report any issues or conflicts found
