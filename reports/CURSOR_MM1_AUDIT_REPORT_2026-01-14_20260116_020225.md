# Cursor MM1 Agent Work Audit Report

**Conversation Date**: 2026-01-14  **Audit Date**: 2026-01-16  **Conversation File**: /Users/brianhellemn/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-vibe.vessel.io@gmail.com/My Drive/system-automation-files/Agents-gd/Cursor-MM1-Agent/Chats-Cursor-MM1-Agent/cursor_notion_first_workflow_test_valid.md  **Audit Status**: PARTIAL

## Executive Summary

- **Work Claims Audited**: 18
- **Verified Successful**: 11 (61.1%)
- **Verified Failed**: 7 (38.9%)
- **Critical Deficiencies**: 2
- **Remediated**: 2
- **Outstanding Issues**: 2

### Key Findings

1. Query completeness fix for incomplete metadata was not present; remediation applied and re-tested.
2. Production run verification shows Notion updates incomplete (Downloaded/Eagle ID/Fingerprint missing) and M4A path mismatch; Eagle import not verified.
3. Verification helper script `check_notion_properties.py` was missing despite being claimed; created during audit.

### User Frustration Events

1 event: User report of missing Eagle import (explicit complaint in transcript).

### Critical Deficiencies

#### DEF-001: Query completeness gap not actually fixed
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: The code did not include Title/Artist metadata completeness checks despite the report claiming it did.
- **Root Cause**: Fix applied only to file path/fingerprint criteria; missing validation for Title/Artist in query and filter.
- **Impact**: Incomplete metadata tracks can be excluded from processing.
- **Remediation Status**: FIXED
- **Evidence**: `scripts/notion_track_queries.py` (added Title/Artist filters and checks, lines ~264-336 & ~347+)

#### DEF-002: Production verification incomplete (Notion + Eagle)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: Notion Downloaded/Eagle ID/Fingerprint not populated; M4A path points to AIFF file; Eagle import not verified.
- **Root Cause**: Notion update may have failed or wrote incorrect values; Eagle verification not performed; local files unavailable.
- **Impact**: Workflow success claims are not substantiated; downstream systems can’t rely on Notion/Eagle state.
- **Remediation Status**: BLOCKED
- **Evidence**: Notion page `2e7e7361-6c27-81e5-891f-fc0af3aaf971` shows Downloaded=false, Eagle File ID empty, M4A path mismatch; local files missing at `/Volumes/VIBES/...`.

### Remediation Actions Taken

1. Added Title/Artist completeness checks and query filters in `scripts/notion_track_queries.py`.
2. Created missing `check_notion_properties.py` verification helper.
3. Re-ran Notion query test and preserved log: `logs/notion_query_test_20260116_015515.log`.

### Outstanding Issues

Issues created in Notion Issues+Questions database:
1. [AUDIT FINDING] Production run Notion updates incomplete — `2eae7361-6c27-81ad-b02e-e09c785aaa57`
2. [AUDIT FINDING] Eagle import not verified — `2eae7361-6c27-8126-be40-f117c6cacb85`

## Agent Behavior Analysis

### Instruction Following Score: 5/10
Followed most requested steps, but claimed fixes and verifications without full evidence (metadata completeness, Eagle import).

### Verification Rigor Score: 4/10
Multiple claims lacked hard evidence; linter checks and Eagle verification were not substantiated.

### Error Handling Score: 6/10
Noted Notion rate limiting but did not fully resolve or re-verify updates post-delay.

### Communication Quality Score: 6/10
Provided detailed reports but included assertions not fully supported by logs or current state.

---

## Recommendations

### For Prompt Authors
1. Require explicit artifact paths for every executed command and verification step.
2. Specify that Eagle verification must include an Eagle API query or Eagle File ID in Notion.

### For Agent Configuration
1. Add a mandatory “property verification” step for Notion updates (Downloaded, file paths, Eagle ID, fingerprint).
2. Gate completion on presence of expected output files and Notion updates.

### For Workflow Process
1. Add a post-run reconciliation script to re-verify Notion updates and Eagle import after rate limiting.
2. Require verification artifacts (logs + screenshots or API responses) for production runs.

## Appendices

### A. Raw Work Claims Registry
(See Work Claim Verification Results table above.)

### B. Verification Command Outputs
- File checks: `check_notion_properties.py` was missing at audit start; created during remediation.
- Notion verification (2026-01-16): Downloaded=false, Eagle File ID empty, M4A path set to AIFF path.
- Local file checks: `/Volumes/VIBES/...` paths missing (volume not mounted).

### C. Remediation Evidence
- `scripts/notion_track_queries.py` updated with Title/Artist criteria.
- `check_notion_properties.py` created.
- `logs/notion_query_test_20260116_015515.log` created.
